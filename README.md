# 🚦 Alam ElSyarat - Traffic Sign Recognition System

## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to **Alam ElSyarat**, a **Traffic Sign Recognition System** designed to detect and classify traffic signs using **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques. This project aims to assist in autonomous driving, road safety, and intelligent transportation systems. 🏎️💡

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Traffic Sign Detection** - Identifies traffic signs from images and video streams.  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** - Trained on a dataset of various traffic signs.  
✅ **Real-time Processing** - Uses OpenCV for fast image analysis.  
✅ **User-friendly Interface** - Displays detected signs in an intuitive format.  
✅ **Scalable & Extendable** - Can be improved with more sign categories and datasets.  

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for deep learning models)
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** (for data processing and visualization)

### 🚀 Quick Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
